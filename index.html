       <div id="q1"><div class="questpoint">
         <div class="subpoint">◈ Destroy the site</div> Dursanna hypothesises that the best way to keep the Cult from perfecting the Ephemera ritual is by destroying whatever research site the party may encounter.<br><br>
         
         <div class="subpoint">✔ Consult Dursanna</div> The scarred cultist the party originally fought might be a sign that the Cult is attempting to recreate a ritual that creates Ephemera, individuals who hold a fragment of a god's power within them. The ritual was allegedly destroyed roughly eleven years ago, but not before it was used.<br><br>
         
         <div class="subpoint">✔ Godmarked</div>The cultist caster has the mark of Pelor carved into their forehead. A similar symbol marks another member of the Shadowfront. </div></div>
       
       <div id="q2"><div class="questpoint">
         <div class="subpoint">◈ Investigate other disappearances</div> You remember overhearing talk of disappearances in the marketplace of Rellholdt City.<br><br>
         
         <div class="subpoint">✔ Find more information</div> You gather that the Cult may be kidnapping arcane users in order to try to turn them into Ephemera.<br><br>
         
         <div class="subpoint">✔ Rescue the sorcerer</div> You rescued a young sorcerer from being kidnapped by the cultists. Eloise's uncertainty of her origins is not the most helpful in determining why the Cult is particularly interested in her. With the cultists dead, the party's avenues for information are limited.</div></div>
       
       <div id="q3"><div class="questpoint">
         
         <div class="subpoint">✔ Pirate Alliances</div> The cultist caster matches the description of a civilian kidnapped from griffon's crest by the red islanders. The potential alliance between the pirates and cult bode particularly ill for some.<br><br>
         
         <div class="subpoint">✔ Blood in the water</div> Investigating a series of reports on the Cult, you find four names associated with them: Knight, Caimys, Blackstone, and Whiteclaw.</div></div>
       
       <div id="q4"><div class="questpoint">
         

         <div class="subpoint">◈ Rescue the Shadowfront spy</div> The changeling agent, Vasiliki, has failed to report her findings over the past few days. Attempts to contact her have been in vain. For better or for worse, you have accepted the mission to find and rescue her if necessary.<br><br>
         
         Vasiliki's last known location is Tartarus, the sunken city of the Bantiren Ocean. You are given an abbreviated version of Vasiliki's reports, which include hypotheses on how to locate the city, as well as a half-drawn map of area.
         </div></div>
       
       <div id="q5"><div class="questpoint">
         
         <div class="subpoint">◈ Travel to Tartarus</div> The portal leads to the Ethereal Plane, which presumably contains another portal that links to Tartarus.<br><br>
         
         <div class="subpoint">✔ Investigate the hidden cove</div> The party's investigations have led them to a hidden cove, its shores littered with necromantic circles of old magic. A faint glow lies under the water's surface.<br><br>
         
         <div class="subpoint">✔ Follow the tracks</div> The cultists were planning on bringing Eloise to Tartarus, but how? the Bantiren Ocean is a good distance away, and travel by ship is both time-consuming and risky. Could portals possibly be in play?
